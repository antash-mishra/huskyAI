One of the people familiar confirmed the documents authenticity. The leak is deeply concerning, a US official told CNN. The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on Telegram by an account called Middle East Spectator. They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its Five Eyes allies Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

REUTERSMohammed SalemFile Photo Mohammed SalemReuters Related livestory The latest on Hamas leaders death and war in the Middle East They describe preparations Israel appears to be making for a strike against Iran. One of the documents, which says it was compiled by the National GeospatialIntelligence Agency, says the plans involve Israel moving munitions around. Another document says it is sourced to the National Security Agency and outlines Israeli air force exercises involving airtosurface missiles, also believed to be in preparation for a strike on Iran. CNN is not quoting directly from or showing the documents. A US official said the investigation is examining who had access to the alleged Pentagon document. Any such leak would automatically trigger an investigation by the FBI alongside the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies. The FBI declined to comment. The leak comes at an extremely sensitive moment in USIsraeli relations and is bound to anger the Israelis, who have been preparing to strike Iran in response to Irans missile barrage on October 1. One of the documents also suggests something that Israel has always declined to confirm publicly that the country has nuclear weapons. The document says the US has not seen any indications that Israel plans to use a nuclear weapon against Iran. If it is true that Israeli tactical plans to respond to Irans attack on October 1 have been leaked, it is a serious breach, said Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and a retired CIA officer. Mulroy added that the future coordination between the US and Israel could be challenged as well. Trust is a key component in the relationship, and depending on how this was leaked that trust could be eroded. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers a speech near the city of Rishon LeZion, Israel, on July 5, 2023. Jack GuezAFPGetty Images Related article US officials expect Israels counterattack on Iran will come before US Election Day The National Security Council referred CNN to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Pentagon for comment. The Pentagon and National GeospatialIntelligence Agency declined to comment. CNN has reached out to the National Security Agency for comment. Another US official said that these two documents are bad, but not horrible. The concern is if there are more. It is not clear how the documents became public, nor whether they were hacked or deliberately leaked. The US is already on high alert about Iranian hacking campaigns US intelligence agencies said in August that Iran had hacked documents belonging to Donald Trumps campaign. Axios first reported on the leaked documents Saturday. A major leak of US intelligence last year also strained the US relationships with allies and partners, including South Korea and Ukraine, after a 21yearold Air National Guardsman posted highly classified information on the social media platform Discord.

      "**Key Points:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Leaked Documents:** Highly classified US intelligence documents, dated Oct 15-16, were leaked online, revealing Israel's plans to retaliate against Iran.\n",
      "2. **Content:** The documents, marked \"top secret,\" describe Israel's preparations for a strike, including moving munitions and air force exercises with air-to-surface missiles.\n",
      "3. **Investigation:** The US is investigating the leak, which is considered \"deeply concerning\" and could erode trust between the US and Israel.\n",
      "4. **Sensitive Timing:** The leak occurs as US-Israeli relations are sensitive, with Israel preparing to strike Iran in response to an October 1 missile barrage.\n",
      "5. **Nuclear Reference:** One document implies Israel has nuclear weapons, but notes no indication of plans to use them against Iran.\n",
      "6. **Potential Consequences:** The leak could challenge future US-Israel coordination, with a former US official stating that \"trust is a key component in the relationship.\"\n",
      "7. **Unclear Origins:** It is unknown how the documents became public, whether through hacking or deliberate leaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reactions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* A US official described the leak as \"bad, but not horrible,\" expressing concern about potential additional leaks.\n",
      "* Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense, highlighted the potential damage to US-Israel trust and coordination.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ongoing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The FBI, Pentagon, and US intelligence agencies are investigating the leak.\n",
      "* The National Security Council, Pentagon, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency have declined to comment or referred inquiries to other agencies."
